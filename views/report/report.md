# Bike Sharing Usage Report on 2020

Data used for this analysis come from Open Data catalogs. These are used by [Neural Bikes](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/neural-bikes-bike-sharing/id1275889928?mt=8&ign-itsct=apps_box&ign-itscg=30200&ign-mpt=uo%3D4) to create daily demand predictions based on recent usage. These are useful for both users and service workers.

This brief report tries to shed some light onto the inherent relations between human behavior and public transport. This is an interesting metric to measure this year as our lives have been affected in every way.

This project is kept alive thanks to donations through [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/javierdemartin).

Data is gathered on ten minutes intervals and that might affect the final values.

## Bilbao

Daily average usage in Bilbao

Prior to the nation-wide lockdown set in Spain, Bilbao's [BilbaoBizi](https://www.bilbaobizi.bilbao.eus/es/bilbao) was open 24/7. Making it an attractive mean of transportation.

In march is was all shut down until it was open back again in june progessively coming back to normal life. Usage has been steadily increasing as more and more people returned to offices. This was also summer season and we should expect more use than in cold season.

Since late august usage has been steadily increasing until reaching pre-lockdown numbers and overtaking them. This seems to indicate that people are doing their normal life as if nothing happened.

## Madrid

BiciMAD's case in Madrid is a bit different from the former. Service was also shut down in march and usage numbers dropped to zero. This service opened back again earlier than Bilbao's. This leads to a progressive usage that reached its peak in late june. Again, surpassing winter's usage. This can't be correlated to the good weather or that people have been using this kind of public transport as it's in open air.

It also seems that Madrid's citizens went on holidays reducing the usage by quite a margin and it was restored back again to normal in september.

Surprisignly usage since september has been decreasing. This might be related to the latest health measures and partial lockdown.
